Valentineâ€™s Day is just around the corner, and there's no better way to someone's heart than a handmade card - which is exactly what we're making in this tutorial. Using the power of HTML and CSS, you'll learn how to develop a website that doubles as a v-day card to wow that special someone in your life.

### HTML and CSS

Websites are made up of many things, but HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the two main components. Together, they are the building blocks for every single webpage on the Internet.

Think of a greeting card. It's made up of many attributes, like text, an image, and perhaps a poem of sorts. In the world of HTML, such attributes are the elements of a webpage. Meanwhile, each of the card's attributes are usually different. Perhaps they differ by size. Or shape. Or color. Back in the web world, CSS is used to define the look and feel of a webpage. 

> Remember: HTML provides structure, while the CSS is used for styling, making websites look pretty.

Now let's turn to an actual web page ..

IMAGE

The image above is an example of what you're going to be creating. As you probably have already guessed you will be customizing this using HTML and CSS. 

Let's begin.

### Development Environment 

For this tutorial we will be using an online HTML, CSS, and Javascript code editor called [CSSDeck](http://cssdeck.com/). Sign up for a free plan [here](http://cssdeck.com/signup). After signing up, navigate to the homepage and click the "New" button to create a new development environment. 

You should see four panes. The three smaller panes on the left are for entering your HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript code, while the large pane displays a quick preview of the entered code.

Let's look at a quick example before building our card. 

#### HTML

The following HTML code displays the text, "Hello, World".

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Hello, world</h1>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**What's going on?**

1. The first line, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the document type declaration, which tells the browser the version of HTML the page is using (HTML5, in our case). Without this, browsers can get confused.
2. `<html>` informs the browser that all code between the opening and closing, `</html>`, tags is HTML.
3. The `<head>` tag contains links to CSS stylesheets and Javascript files that we wish to use in our web page, as well as meta information used by search engines for classification.
4. All code that falls within the `<body>` tags are part of the main content of the page, which will appear in the browser to the end user.

This is how a standard HTML page is structured.

Copy this code in the HTML pane on CSSDeck. You should see the text "Hello, World" in the preview pane.

Next, let's add some styles.

#### CSS

The following is a what a standard CSS stylesheet looks like:

```css
.container {
  padding-top: 50px;
}

body {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

**What's going on?**

1. The `.container` selector is associated with the same selector in our HTML document (check it out), followed by curly braces.
2. Inside the curly braces, we have a properties, which are descriptive words, like font-weight, font-size, or background color. In our case, we have `padding-top`.
3. Values are then assigned to each property, which are preceded by a colon and followed by a semi-colon. 

  > http://cssvalues.com/ is an excellent resource for finding the acceptable values given a CSS property. 

Can you figure out what's going on with the body tag?

Copy and paste this code into the CSS pane of CSSDeck. Check out the preview.

Congrats. You just made your first webpage!

### V-Day Card

Now let's develop our card using the following HTML elements-
- Header Text
- Image
- Paragraph Text 
- Button

Each of the elements will be styled using CSS. We'll also be applying a border, which is stictly a CSS style.

Start by creating a new development environment on CSSDeck. 

#### Add boilerplate

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is similar to the previous example only now we have a blank canvas to work with.

#### Page title

Add a title to your card. 

```html
<title>Happy Valentine's Day!</title>
```

#### Border

```CSS
body {
  border: 20px solid #fcd2d8;  
}
```
The border property contactins the following values - 
`border-width` `border-style` `border-color`

Try changing these values. Play with the pixel size until you get the right width. Try a `dashed` or `dotted` value for the style, and find a pretty color [here](http://color.hailpixel.com/). *Developer hint:* Use that special someone's favorite color!

#### Header


update to paragraph ...

Add the following header to your card beneath the opening `<body>` tag:

```html
<h1>Happy Valentine's Day<h1>
```

Headers include the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>` and `<h6>` tags. `<h1>` is the main heading and the remaining headings decrease in size, with `<h6>` being the smallest. It's best practice to use the `<h1>` tag only once per page, while the other tags can be used any number of times, but they should always be in order. In other words, `<h3>` should be a sub-heading of `<h2>` and `<h4>` should be a sub-heading of `<h3>`, and so forth. 

Next, add a CSS selector to the opening `<h1>` tag:

```html
<h1 class="header">
```

With this tag, we can assign styles to it by referencing it in our CSS stylesheet:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
  font-size: 68px;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 50px;
}
```
