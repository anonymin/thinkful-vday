# TITLE GOES HERE

Valentineâ€™s Day is just around the corner, and there's no better way to someone's heart than a handmade card - which is exactly what we're making in this tutorial. Using the power of HTML and CSS, you'll learn how to develop a website that doubles as a v-day card to wow that special someone in your life.

### HTML and CSS

Websites are made up of many things, but HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the two main components. Together, they are the building blocks for every single webpage on the Internet.

Think of a greeting card. It's made up of many attributes, like text, an image, and perhaps a poem of sorts. In the world of HTML, such attributes are the elements of a webpage. Meanwhile, each of the card's attributes are usually different. Perhaps they differ by size. Or shape. Or color. Back in the web world, CSS is used to define the look and feel of a webpage. 

> Remember: HTML provides structure, while the CSS is used for styling, making websites look pretty. **For more information on HTML and CSS basics, check out the beginner tutorials [here](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/terminology-syntax-intro) and [here](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/).**

Now let's turn to an actual web page ...

IMAGE (http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/npulm7vr)

The image above is an example of what we're going to be creating, using just HTML and CSS. 

### Setup

For this tutorial we will be using an online HTML, CSS, and Javascript code editor called [CSSDeck](http://cssdeck.com/). Sign up for a free plan [here](http://cssdeck.com/signup). After signing up, navigate to the homepage and click the "New" button to create a new environment for us to work in. 

You should see four panes. The three smaller panes on the left are for entering your HTML, CSS, or Javascript code, while the large pane displays a preview of the how the webpage will *actually* look.

### Our Card's Structure (HTML)

We'll be using the following HTML tags to develop our card-
- Title: `<title>`
- Header: `<h1>`
- Image: `<img>`
- Paragraph: `<p>`
- Divider: `<div>`
- Anchor: `<a>`

Each of the tags will be styled using CSS. We'll also be applying a border around the entire webpage, which is stictly a CSS style.

#### Add basic structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Copy and paste this basic webpage structure into the HTML pane within CSSDeck. 

This structure is commonly referred to as a boilerplate template. These are used to speed up development so you don't have to code the features common to every single webpage each time you create a new page.

**What's going on?**

1. The first line, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the document type declaration, which tells the browser the version of HTML the page is using (HTML5, in our case).
2. `<html>` informs the browser that all code between the opening and closing, `</html>`, tags is HTML.
3. The `<head>` tag contains links to CSS stylesheets and Javascript files that we wish to use in our web page, as well as meta information used by search engines.
4. All code that falls within the `<body>` tags are part of the main content of the page, which will appear in the browser to the end user.

This is how a standard HTML page is structured.

Add a the following element to the page within the `<body>` tags:

```html
<h1>Hello, World</h1>
```

Check out the preview pane. You should see the header text, "Hello, World".

Congrats! You just made a webpage. (Your first?!)

#### Title

Add a title to your card between in the page head (`<head></head>`): 

```html
<title>Happy Valentine's Day!</title>
```

#### Header

Update the header in your card:

```html
<h1>Happy Valentine's Day</h1>
```

[http://cssdeck.com/labs/62mmslgp](http://cssdeck.com/labs/62mmslgp)

Headers include the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>` and `<h6>` tags. `<h1>` is the main heading and the remaining headings decrease in size, with `<h6>` being the smallest. It's best practice to use the `<h1>` tag only once per page, while the other tags can be used any number of times, but they should always be in order. In other words, `<h3>` should be a sub-heading of `<h2>` and `<h4>` should be a sub-heading of `<h3>`, and so forth. 

#### Image

Insert an image just below the header:

```html
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/a2tjOcm.png">
```

#### Paragraph Text

Say something sweet. Add some paragraph text:

```html
<p>Write your personal message here</p>
```

#### Divider

Let's create a button using the divider tag that will link to a video:

```html
<div>click here to get your present</div>
```

Doesn't look much like a button yet. *Hint: That's where CSS comes into play.**

####

Finally, surround the button - e.g., `<div>` - with a link:

```html
<a href="/"><div>click here to get your present</div></a>
```

[http://cssdeck.com/labs/m9d3pqjy](http://cssdeck.com/labs/m9d3pqjy)

Well, we've added all the HTML structure to our page. Check out the fullscreen preview [here](http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/m9d3pqjy).

Kind of bland. We can quickly change that with CSS!

### Our Card's Style (CSS)

From the size of the text to the background colors to the positioning of HTML elements, CSS gives you control over almost every visual aspect of a page.

CSS and HTML work in tandem. CSS styles (or rules) are applied directly to HTML elements using selectors. 

We're going to add three selectors to our HTML page:

1. `.header`
2. `.msg`
3. `.button`

[http://cssdeck.com/labs/epx8vf9o](http://cssdeck.com/labs/epx8vf9o)

#### Header

```css
#header {
  font-size: 68px;
  margin-top: 50px;
}
```

Copy and paste this into the CSS pane within CSSDeck.

**What's going on?**

1. We have the `#header` selector, which is associated with the selector in our HTML document, followed by curly braces.
2. Inside the curly braces, we have properties, which are descriptive words, like font-weight, font-size, or background color. In our case, we have `font-size` and `margin-top`.
3. Values are then assigned to each property, which are preceded by a colon and followed by a semi-colon.

#### Paragraph Text

Update the style of your personal message:

```css
#msg {
  font-style: italic;
  font-size: 36px;
  color: #f12469;
  margin-top: 50px;
}
```

[http://cssdeck.com/labs/brkeecsj](http://cssdeck.com/labs/brkeecsj)

#### Divider

Let's make that button look like a button:

```css
#button {
  border-radius: 30px;
  height: 40px;
  width: 335px; 
  background-color: #f12469;
  font-size: 20px;
  color: #ffffff;
  margin:0 auto;
  padding-top: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 50px;
}
```

[http://cssdeck.com/labs/zh2itiuj](http://cssdeck.com/labs/zh2itiuj)

The text is still a bit .. off. Let's fix that.

#### Additional CSS

```css
body {
  font-family: "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
  border: 20px solid #fcd2d8;
  text-align: center;
}

a {
  color: #ffffff;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```
