Valentineâ€™s Day is just around the corner, and there's no better way to someone's heart than a handmade card - which is exactly what we're going to be making in this tutorial. Using the power of HTML and CSS, you'll learn how develop a website that doubles as a v-day card to wow that special someone in your life.

### HTML and CSS

Websites are made up of many things, but HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the two main components. Together, they are the building blocks for every single webpage on the Internet.

Think of a greeting card. It's made up of many attributes, like text, an image, and perhaps a poem of sorts. In the world of HTML, such attributes are the elements of a webpage. Meanwhile, each of the card's attributes are usually different. Perhaps they differ by size. Or shape. Or color. Back in the web world, CSS is used to define the look and feel of a webpage. 

> Remember: HTML provides structure, while the CSS is used for styling, making websites look pretty.

Now let's turn to an actual web page ..
